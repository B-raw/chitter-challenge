Chitter Challenge
=================

This is my go at the Maker's Academy Chitter Challenge - to build a Twitter clone. It offers the following features:

* Sign up
* Log in
* Log out
* Can view peeps (tweets) whether logged in or logged out
* Can only post peeps when logged in
* Peeps state the time they were posted
* Peeps are posted in reverse chronological order

Viewing the App locally
------
* Clone this repo
`` git clone https://github.com/B-raw/chitter-challenge.git ``

* Bundle the dependencies

`` bundle ``

* Create your database of choice with the following name:
``createdb chitter_development``

* Run rspec to try the tests

* Rackup to load the app to localhost in your browser

CSS Design and Style Inspiration
------
I was listening to the Wild Beasts latest album "Boy King" whilst coding this challenge. I checked out their website and loved the big bold colours and design. That served as a large part of the inspiration for this design.
